# AirBnB_clone - **The Console**
We are working towards web applicaion similar to the Airbnb website. This project is the first step in building the AirBnB clone, it will encompass various components like HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, and front-end integration. The objective of this project is to develop a command interpreter that will manage AirBnB objects. 

## Description of the Command Interpreter
It is a simple framework for writing line-oriented commands. It will be used to manage the objects of our project:
  
   - Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
   - Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
   - Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
   - Update attributes of an object
   - Destroy an object

## How to Start

### To start using the AirBnB Clone Command Interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Odarell35/Airbnb-clone.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Airbnb-clone
   ```

3. Install any necessary dependencies. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

## How to Use

### Once you have the project set up, you can use the command interpreter by following these steps:

  1. Launch the command interpreter by running the following command:

    ```
    python3 console.py
    ```
    
  2. You will be presented with a prompt where you can enter various commands to manage AirBnB objects.
  

  3. Use commands like create, show, update, destroy, and all to interact with the objects. Refer to the examples section below for more details.

## Examples

- Create a new user:
  ```
  (hbnb) create User1
  ```

- Show details of a specific object:
  ```
  (hbnb) show User1
  ```

- Update an object's attributes:
  ```
  (hbnb) update User1 first_name "Betty"
  ```
